# 🌊 Waves of the Wild  

 
**Stage:** Initial Setup and Prototype Foundation  

## 🪶 Overview  
**Waves of the Wild** is a 2D atmospheric adventure built with **Python + Pygame**.  
This early prototype establishes the project structure and the first visual layer — a calm sky with moving parallax clouds that will later form the backdrop for exploration, wildlife, and environmental storytelling.  

The game is being developed as part of **Game Off 2025**, starting with basic scene setup and smooth rendering to ensure future expandability for gameplay systems such as player movement, physics, and interaction.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python 3.12  
- **Library:** Pygame 2.6.1  
- **Environment:** WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  

---

## 🧩 Features (Prototype Stage)  
- Initialized project structure with virtual environment  
- Configured Pygame window (800 × 600 px)  
- Added sky background color *(Sky Blue — RGB 135, 206, 235)*  
- Created ground layer *(Jungle Green + Dark Soil)*  
- Implemented parallax cloud layers for visual depth  
- Organized assets and scripts for scalable development
